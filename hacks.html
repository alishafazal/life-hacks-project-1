            <p>
                Cut your finger? To prevent plasters from sliding off your fingers so easily, cut a
                slit on either side of the plaster to create four smaller sticky strips. You
                can then criss-cross the strips over each other to create a more secure fit.

            <img src="assets/images/plaster.webp" alt="Person applying a plaster to their finger">
            <p>
                If you are ever faced in a situation where your cans of soda are warm but you don't have
                time for them to cool in the fridge, simply fill a large container with ice and water and
                add a generous amount of salt. Stir the mixture until all the salt has dissolved and add in
                your cans (make sure they are sealed!). Leave for around 5 minutes and you will have perfectly
                chilled drinks!

            <p>
                If you ever find yourself moving heavy items such as books and boxes don't cut it, use
                a suitcase. Simply place your heavy items within a suitcase and you will be able to transport
                your heavy items with greater ease by wheeling them from one destinaition to another.

            <p>
                To make washing oily tuppaware easy, place hot water, washing up liquid and a piece of
                tissue in your oil stained tuppaware box and seal the container with the lid.
                Shake vigorously for around 30-45 seconds and all the oil will be stripped away.

            <p>
                Got chewing gum stuck in your hair or in the carpet? Don't worry! Simply put
                some ice cubes in a resealable bag and place on the the piece of stuck chewing
                gum until it becomes hard and brittle. Once its reached this stage you can easily
                pick it off or use a spoon to scrape it off of carpeted areas.

            <img src="assets/images/plaster.webp" alt="Person applying a plaster to their finger">
            <p>
                If you dont want your iced coffees to get watered down by ice cubes made from
                water, then use ice cubes made from coffee! Fill your ice cube tray with coffee
                and allow to freeze and then use in place of regular ice cubes. Even if you're 
                not a coffee drinker, you can use this hack for any chilled beverage such as
                fruit juices.
