# Life Hacks
For this project, my aim was to create a site that provides users with useful life hacks that are intuitive and easy to follow. The intent of this site is to provide simple solutions to life's small difficulties and is intended for anyone who would like to learn these solutions in order to make their life eaiser.

### Colour Scheme
As the sites main goal is to make life eaiser, I decided to use shades of off-white and beige to give the site a feeling of calmness, peace and warmth to reflect this. I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to find the below colour pallete.

I settled on using the lightest colour and the second darkest colour in this pallete to create a clear contrast between the header, main body and footer. Because of my choice of background colours, I decided to colour the text and icons black to provide a clear contrast between them.
