# Life Hacks
For this project, my aim was to create a site that provides users with useful life hacks that are intuitive and easy to follow. The intent of this site is to provide simple solutions to life's small difficulties and is intended for anyone who would like to learn these solutions in order to make their life eaiser.

# UX
### Site Purpose
To provide intutive and easy to follow life hacks for people to follow and test for themselves.

# Design
### Wireframes
I sketched out my wireframes by hand so I could have a visual guide as to where I would place certain elements and to overall help me structure the site.

### Colour Scheme
As the main goal of the site is to make life eaiser, I decided to use shades of off-white and beige to give the site a feeling of calmness, peace and warmth to reflect this. I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to find the below colour pallete.

I settled on using #FAF5F0 and #F0E2D3 in this pallete to create a clear contrast between the header, main body and footer. Because of my choice of background colours, I decided to colour the text and icons black (#000000) to provide clear contrast between them.

### Typography
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used to source all fonts on the site. I chose to use Roboto as the font for the logo because I liked how clean-cut yet simple it is, aiding in the easy-going feel I wanted the site to have. For all other text, Roboto Flex was used. I feel like the two fonts compliment each other well and they are not distracting for the user.

### Images

All images on the site were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/images). The hero image was chosen as it sets the tone of the site instantly for the user. For each life hack, I included a clear and relevant photo to demonstrate what the hack is about, aiding in user understanding.
